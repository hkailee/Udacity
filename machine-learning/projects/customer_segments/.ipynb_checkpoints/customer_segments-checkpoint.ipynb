One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.\n",
    " - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`."

    "### Implementation: Outlier Detection\n",
    "Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many \"rules of thumb\" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identifying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.\n",
    " - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.\n",
    " - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.\n",
    " - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  \n",
    "Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`."

In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new \"feature\" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.\n",

The 1st PC/Dimension could represent customer spending group highly related to convenient stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, the 2nd PC/dimension provided the highest information gains from the 3 features least explainable by 1st PC (i.e. 'Delicatessen', 'Frozen', and 'Fresh'). This PC provided small gains from 'Milk' and 'Grocery', and a small loss from 'Detergents_Paper'. This PC/dimension could possibly represent customer spending group highly related to restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3rd PC/dimension provided gains from 'Delicatessen', 'Frozen', 'Milk', and signficant losses from 'Fresh'. This could represent customer spending group highly related to Delis or coffeeshops.\n",

    "The 4th PC/dimension provided gains mainly from 'Delicatessen' and 'Fresh', but significant losses from 'Frozen' and 'Detergents_Paper'. This could represent customer spending group highly related to wet markets\n"

    "### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data — in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.\n",

    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.\n",
    " - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.\n",
    " - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`."

    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using a K-Means clustering algorithm is its simplicity and speed of completion which aim to partition the n observations into k (≤ n) clusters so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (distance of each observation from an assigned/updated cluster center during each iteration). The K-means will eventually converge (locally) on the K-clusters after sufficient iterations (depending on the complexity of data), However, the algorithm is best to be performed on data that are well separated. The local minimum convergence is depending much on the initial cluster centers assigned and the outcome may vary for each new initialization if there is no clearly defined clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the advantage of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), is its capability of incorporating more flexible covariance between the points into the model to identify more complex clusters. With GMM, each cluster can have unconstrained covariance structure. It allows rotated and/or elongated distribution of points in a cluster, instead of spherical as in K-Means. Besides, GMM model allows mixed membership of points to different clusters. In K-Means, a point can only belong to one cluster, whereas in GMM a point belongs to each cluster to a different degree. The degree is based on the probability of the point being generated from each cluster’s (multivariate) normal distribution, with cluster center as the distribution’s mean and cluster covariance as its covariance. This capability tends to perform well on less clearly defined/separated dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the biplot above, the data points are mostly fall on 1 area and do not form clearly separated clusters. Therefore, applying a Gausian Mixture Model may produce a better outcome for the problem."

    "### Implementation: Creating Clusters\n",
    "Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.\n",
    " - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.\n",
    " - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.\n",
    " - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.\n",
    " - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.\n",
    "   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result."

These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.\n",

However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. \n",

    "There are 2 obvious characteristics identified in this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer group (Cluster 0) that has bulk orders mainly on 'Fresh' and 'Frozen' products. These products will likely require more frequent delivery to retain freshness of food. They are more likely to react negatively to less frequent delivery service.  \n",

    "2. Customer group (Cluster 1) that has bulk orders mainly on 'Milk', 'Glocery', and 'Detergents_Paper'. These products has longer shelf-life.  Stocking up these items to accomodate less frequent delivery in a week probably will not affect the quality of the products too much. They are more likely to react positively to less frequent delivery service. In fact, I suspect some of them may not be using the daily delivery service at all.  \n",

Inferential statistical analyses can then be performed based on customer feedback or any positive or negative change of overall monthly ordering amount by each testing and control group in each cluster. \n"

However, there is a grey zone (not well-defined separation) which the model couldn't not discern the customers well, for instance, the Sample 0 that i have chosen fell on this grey zone. I have predicted it as HoReCa-related industry but the model has predicted it as retailer-related industry. \n",
