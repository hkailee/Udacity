    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "- I would expect a neighborhood that has an 'LSTAT' value (percent of lower class worker) of 15 have home prices be worth more than that of 20. Higher neighborhood poverty means that the buying power is lower hence demand of owning a home is lower.\n",

    "The effect of increasing number of training points on:\n",
    "1. training score: for the first few training points, the training score is at or closer to 1. This usually happened as the variances (deviations within the data) or standard deviation (STD) are smaller during this stage. These deviations at the TOP RIGHT graph grew larger to a point where convergence of the STD reached. At the same time, the corresponding training score converged to a value around 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. testing score: for the first few testing points, the testing score is at or close to 0. The overfitting effect of the trained model happened as the decision tree regression is not explaining for sufficient representative of the population. However, the testing score of this decision tree goes up quickly and converges to a value slighly below the training score, indicating good generalization. If the minimum max_depth was choosen, the testing score can go up drastically.\n",

The higher variance towards the higher maximum depth after 5 can be explained by the validation score started to dropped because of **increasing false positive/false negative results (hence high variance)** postulated by an **overfitting model**."

    "Grid search is considered benchmarking technique in the industries where it systematically applies a set of parameters combinations for modeling to look for a parameters combination/set that achieves the best or expected performance metrics of the model. A grid search technique exhaustively tries every combination of series of hyper-parameter values (where you tune or change the value) from one or multiple parameters (which we choose for tuning), in order to find the best model. The hyper-parameters with the highest cross-validation accuracy (eg. highest F1 score of the validation/testing set) is considered the best model.\n",

    "For example, considering the decision tree above, we can use the grid search determine the best maximum depth (hyper-parameters) for the model complexities. Here, a grid over the max_depth values 1-10 were applied to evaluate the validation score of the decision tree performance. A more complexed grid search could be a SVM modeling that you can apply different degrees of both Kernel and Gamma in contingency manner to obtain the best/optimal validation score."

    "k-fold cross validation is a process that involves splitting the same dataset randomly into training and validation sets repeatedly for model training and evaluation. In other words, we are recycling the limited data multiple times to achieve a better training and evaluation results. Briefly, the entire dataset is first divided randomly into initial training and testing subsets. Next, the initial training set is equally divided into k chunks, where one of the chunks is used for validation and the remaining (k-1)chunks are used for training. Then we repeat/iterate this process for k times (suffling the data before each process is recommeded to avoid any hidden bias). With this, we will eventually get k times of trained and evaluated models with its validation scores. Averaging all the validation scores will give us a more reliable validation score. Lastly, the validated model is tested and evaluated using the testing subset we put aside earlier.\n",

    "Training data: optimizing the model's parameter values\n",
    "Validatio data: optimizing the model's architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "In grid search, if the same subset of data for training or testing are used for the multiple times evaluation using different points on the grid, the best point on the grid obtained may still be subjected to the random chance of earlier training and testing subset selection, especially when the overall dataset is small. The 2nd drawback of performing grid search to determine the optimal model complexity prameters is its bottleneck/vulnerability affected by a small data size of both training and validation sets (causing overfitting). With addition of  this technique during the grid search (hence bigger effective size), we can minimize such bottleneck and achieve the converged variance/STD of the various parameters for estimating the model performance. As such, k-fold cross-validation technique during grid search can provide a more accurate model curation and performance evaluation. \n"

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",
    "  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable."

    "   The prediction power for **relative comparison between homes** may still be valid, but not the absolute price estimation of /comparison between the home prices. The inflation will affect the home's price, MEDV, but that may vary and inaccurate by just a simple multiplicatively scaling as there may be other factors affecting the pricing, for instance, a price cooling measure by the government.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The features included in this model may not be sufficient to give a similar performance for estimation today. There are more structured neighborhood planning for the living, with focus on facilities and accessibilities, not just on the overall development convenient for work and living. Besides the quality of appliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool, there are special interest considering the serenity and quality of or environment or degree of polutions/noice when choosing a home for living. This is particularly true for a highly urbanized but small city (eg. Singapore and Hong Kong) where public transportation is easily accessible from any neighborhood and no longer an important consideration when choosing a home. \n",
    "\n",
    "   The precision is not high in this modeling as the 10 trials rendered a range of estimates ranging from 351,577 to 424,935. For people considering buying/selling a house, this variation is considerably large for decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Lastly, the data collected in urban city and rural city should be analysed and modelled separately. There may be more predictors/variables that are significant to affect the prediction outcomes in urban city, eg. the saturation of financial district, professional R & D engineering regions, etc. The rural city could be more significantly affected by the transportation accessibilities compared to the urban city where regular public transportation are usually availalb in whole city. I think it is fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characterstics of the entire neighborhood, but different persons may have different perceptives towards home buying, including future development projects available in the neighborhood that my affect the pricing of the house in near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final recommendation: the constructed model may not be suitable to used in prediction of housing price in a real-world setting, even the MEDV has been scaled to account for the 35 years market inflation. However, I feel it is useful to reason (in terms of education quality and buying power of the neighborhood) why the pricing difference of 2 houses, if there is an occassion that the house has an apparent difference in room count, especially for a foreign buyers who are not coming from Boston."
