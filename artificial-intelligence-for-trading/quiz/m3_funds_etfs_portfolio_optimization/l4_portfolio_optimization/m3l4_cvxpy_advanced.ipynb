We can use [numpy.cov](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html) to get the covariance.  We give it a 2D array in which each row is a stock series, and each column is an observation at the same period of time.\n",

    "### portfolio variance\n",
    "We can write the portfolio variance $\\sigma^2_p = \\mathbf{x^T} \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the $\\mathbf{x^T} \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{x}$ is called the quadratic form.\n",
    "We can use the cvxpy function `quad_form(x,P)` to get the quadratic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance from index weights\n",
    "We want portfolio weights that track the index closely.  So we want to minimize the distance between them.\n",
    "Recall from the Pythagorean theorem that you can get the distance between two points in an x,y plane by adding the square of the x and y distances and taking the square root.  Extending this to any number of dimensions is called the L2 norm.  So: $\\sqrt{\\sum_{1}^{n}(weight_i - indexWeight_i)^2}$  Can also be written as $\\left \\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{index} \\right \\|_2$.  There's a cvxpy function called [norm()](https://www.cvxpy.org/api_reference/cvxpy.atoms.other_atoms.html#norm)\n",
    "`norm(x, p=2, axis=None)`.  The default is already set to find an L2 norm, so you would pass in one argument, which is the difference between your portfolio weights and the index weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### objective function\n",
    "We want to minimize both the portfolio variance and the distance of the portfolio weights from the index weights.\n",
    "We also want to choose a `scale` constant, which is $\\lambda$ in the expression. This lets us choose how much priority we give to minimizing the difference from the index, relative to minimizing the variance of the portfolio.  If you choose a higher value for `scale` ($\\lambda$), do you think this gives more priority to minimizing the difference, or minimizing the variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the objective function using cvxpy `objective = cvx.Minimize()`.  Can you guess what to pass into this function?\n",
    "\n",
    "### constraints\n",
    "We can also define our constraints in a list.  For example, you'd want the weights to sum to one. So $\\sum_{1}^{n}x = 1$.  You may also need to go long only, which means no shorting, so no negative weights.  So $x_i >0 $ for all $i$. you could save a variable as `[x >= 0, sum(x) == 1]`, where x was created using `cvx.Variable()`."
